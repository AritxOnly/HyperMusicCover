 * be seen, the doze, and what the lock screen gives up for it (the clock goes small, the
 * wallpaper's cut-out goes). A scene only answers what is its own:
 *
 *   which island opens it   - {@link #serves}
 *   whether it can open     - {@link #ready}, told to the host with ImmersiveHost.readyChanged
 *   what it shows           - {@link #prepare} puts it into the host's slot; it tells the host
 *                             ImmersiveHost.contentChanged once there is something to show, and
 *                             {@link #hasContent} answers from then on
 *   how the doze keeps it   - {@link #needsDozeBeat}
 *
